# MultiZone — Student Project

This is a small student-made demo website built as a class assignment. It demonstrates a multi-zone layout (student, hospital, career, women) with a simple authentication flow and demo dashboard.

Notes:
- This is not production-ready. It's a learning exercise with simplified code and mock interactions.
- Some pages use placeholder data and basic client-side logic only.

If you are using this for a class, feel free to edit files directly and keep things simple — messy code is fine for learning!

Project structure (trimmed):
```
my-website/
├── index.html
├── auth/                 # signup, login, otp, onboarding (demo)
├── dashboard/            # example dashboard page
├── sections/             # content pages for different zones
└── assets/               # css, js, images
```

How to run:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Try `auth/signup.html` or `auth/login.html` to see demo flows.
